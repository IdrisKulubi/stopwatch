## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

## **Note: First create an issue then make a pull request :)**

## **How to be a contributor to the project 😎**<br>

### **1. Star The Repo :star2:**

- Star this repository by pressing the top-rightmost button to start your incredible journey.
- Create an issue describing how you want to contribute to this project.

### **2. Fork it :fork_and_knife:**

- Then fork this repository by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button on top-right of your screen.

- In the forked repository add your changes.

### **3. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:**

`NOTE: commands are to be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows(using Powershell)`

- You need to clone (download) it to a local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

- Then make a pull request with the issue number.
- Once you have cloned the stopwatch repository in Github, move to that folder first using the change directory command on Linux, Mac, and Windows(PowerShell to be used).

```sh
# This will change the directory to a folder stopwatch
$ cd stopwatch
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### **4. Set it up ⬆️**

- Run the following commands to see that your local copy has a reference to your forked remote repository in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git (push)
```

Now, let's add a reference to the original stopwatch repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/avinash201199/stopwatch.git
```

This adds a new remote named upstream.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/stopwatch.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/stopwatch.git (push)
```

In your case, you will see

```sh
$ git remote -V
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/stopwatch.git(push)
upstream  https://github.com/ietebitmesra/stopwatch.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ietebitmesra/stopwatch.git (push)
```

### **5. Sync it ♻️**

- Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository. Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands carefully to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches ``
$ git fetch --all --prune
```

```sh
# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master
```

```sh
# Reset local `master` branch to match the `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
```

```sh
# Push changes to your forked `stopwatch` repo
$ git push origin master
```

### **6. Ready Steady Go... 🐢 🐇**

- Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our Help Wanted Issues and creating pull requests.

### **7. Create a new branch ‼️**

- Whenever you are going to contribute. Please create a separate branch using command and keep your master branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b BranchName
```

- Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use the same name of the branch as of folder.

To switch to the desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout BranchName
To add the changes to the branch. Use
```

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using
```

```sh
# This message gets associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin BranchName
```

- Finally, go to your repository in the browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious efforts

### **8. Pull requests should have screenshots of the changes you have made.**

### **9. Wait for review. :heart:**
